							<h2>
								Rainy Days was born on a stormy night, high up in the mountains.
							</h2>
							<div id="about--history-content">
								<p>
									The founder, John, was an avid hiker and nature lover who
									struggled to find a durable and functional rain jacket that
									didn't break the bank. He had tried dozens of brands and
									models, but they all fell short of his expectations.
								</p>

								<p>
									One day, during a particularly bad storm, John decided to take
									matters into his own hands. He spent hours in his workshop,
									experimenting with different materials, designs, and features,
									until he finally created a rain jacket that surpassed his
									wildest dreams. It was waterproof, windproof, breathable, and
									stylish, all at the same time. He wore it on his next hiking
									trip and was amazed at how comfortable and protected he felt,
									even in the worst weather conditions.
								</p>

								<p>
									Soon, John's friends and fellow hikers caught wind of his
									creation and begged him to make jackets for them too. He
									started selling his jackets out of his garage, and before he
									knew it, he had a small but loyal following of customers who
									loved his products.
								</p>

								<p>
									As word spread, Rainy Days grew in popularity, and John
									decided to take his business online. He continued to design
									and manufacture jackets that prioritized durability,
									functionality, and affordability, all while staying true to
									his love for nature and the outdoors.
								</p>

								<p>
									Today, Rainy Days is a well-known brand that serves customers
									around the world, but it never forgets its humble beginnings.
									The spirit of innovation, passion, and adventure that inspired
									John's first rain jacket still lives on in every product that
									Rainy Days creates.
